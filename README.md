# Hepheastus Informatics Tasks

This document refers to the informatics tasks that need to be accomplished by team members to understand basic development concepts for service construction, data analysis, and more! A graph will also be provided to help understand the roadmap of these tasks and the desired outcomes.

##### !DISCLAIMER!
Tasks will vary based on your developer specification. Developer specifications for our team include:
- **Front-end Developers**: Responsible for developing the desktop, web, and mobile applications of our team.
- **Back-end Developers**: Responsible for creating the services (servers and more) and CLI tools that the team will need, along with communication systems between the "robots."
- **Hardware Developers**: Responsible for developing the software needed for various robots to function properly.
- **Data Analysts** (Coming soon): Responsible for creating data analysis software (AI and more) and will work closely with the back-end developers, as these two roles are closely related.

### Skills That Need to Be Learned
It is important to understand why these tasks are being assigned! Hepheastus aims to be an innovative team within the University of Peloponnese community. By creating projects that will elevate our campus in international competitions, the informatics team needs to acquire the following knowledge:
- **Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS**: For front-end representation (Front-end).
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: For creating secure, fast, and robust front-end applications (Front-end).
- **Kotlin**: For creating mobile apps and the most secure, fast back-end services (Front-end, Back-end).
- **Python**: For data science and analysis, particularly for AI development (Data Analyst, Back-end).
- **Rust/C**: For hardware development (Hardware, Back-end).

These skills are essential for building an informatics team that will drive Hepheastus forward.
