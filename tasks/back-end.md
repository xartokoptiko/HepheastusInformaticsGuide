# Back-End Developer Specification

This document outlines the tasks and skills required for back-end developers in the Hepheastus Informatics team. As a back-end developer, your focus will be on building secure, fast, and reliable services that connect various robotics applications, as well as developing CLI tools and managing data communications between "robots" and the cloud.

## Key Responsibilities

- Develop and maintain the core server-side logic and databases.
- Create secure and performant APIs for the front-end and hardware teams.
- Build and optimize communication protocols between robots, drones, or other systems.
- Design and implement CLI tools for data processing and system automation.
- Collaborate closely with the front-end and hardware developers to ensure seamless integration.

## Required Skills

To succeed as a back-end developer in the Hepheastus Informatics team, you will need the following skills:

- **Kotlin**: For building robust and scalable back-end services using Spring Boot.
- **Python**: For data analysis, scripting, and automation.
- **Rust/C**: For hardware-level programming and creating performance-critical back-end services.
- **RESTful APIs**: Knowledge of API development and integration.
- **Databases (SQL/NoSQL)**: Understanding of relational and non-relational database systems.
- **Version Control (Git/GitHub)**: For collaborating with the team and managing code.

## Suggested Learning Roadmap

Below are tasks designed to help you acquire and develop the necessary back-end skills.
