# Data Analyst Specification

### !DISCLAIMER!
This developer specification will be needed yet as there needs to be serious knowledge on software develpment , maths and data analysis 

This document outlines the tasks and skills required for data analysts in the Hepheastus Informatics team. As a data analyst, your primary focus will be on developing data analysis tools and AI models to assist in robotics and other projects. You’ll work closely with the back-end team to ensure that data collection, processing, and analysis are efficient and effective.

## Key Responsibilities

- Collect, clean, and analyze data from various sources (robot sensors, cloud services, etc.).
- Develop machine learning models and AI tools for robotics projects.
- Collaborate with back-end developers to ensure smooth data flow and integration.
- Visualize data to inform team decisions and improve robotic systems.
- Provide insights and data-driven recommendations to optimize projects.

## Required Skills

To excel as a data analyst in the Hepheastus Informatics team, you will need to develop the following skills:

- **Python**: For data analysis, scripting, and machine learning.
- **Data Science Libraries**: Familiarity with libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
- **Machine Learning**: Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts and frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **SQL/NoSQL**: For working with databases and querying data.
- **Data Visualization**: Ability to present data clearly using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
- **Version Control (Git/GitHub)**: For managing code and collaborating with other team members.

## Suggested Learning Roadmap

Below are tasks designed to help you acquire and develop the necessary data analysis skills.

### 1. Python for Data Analysis
   - **Task**: Write a Python script to load and clean a dataset (e.g., a CSV file) using pandas.
   - **Skills Covered**: Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation with pandas.

### 2. Data Visualization
   - **Task**: Create visualizations of your dataset using Matplotlib or Seaborn to analyze trends and insights.
   - **Skills Covered**: Data plotting, bar charts, line graphs, histograms, and data distribution analysis.

### 3. Machine Learning Basics
   - **Task**: Build a simple linear regression model to predict future values based on historical data.
   - **Skills Covered**: Regression, training/test data split, evaluating model accuracy.

### 4. Work with SQL/NoSQL Databases
   - **Task**: Use SQL to query a relational database or NoSQL to retrieve data from a MongoDB collection.
   - **Skills Covered**: Writing queries, filtering data, joins, aggregations.

### 5. Collaborate with the Back-End Team
   - **Task**: Develop a Python script that collects data from a back-end API and processes it for analysis.
   - **Skills Covered**: HTTP requests, working with JSON data, data pipelines.

### 6. Explore Machine Learning Algorithms
   - **Task**: Train a classification model (e.g., Decision Trees, KNN, or SVM) using a robotics-related dataset (e.g., object recognition or sensor data).
   - **Skills Covered**: Classification algorithms, data preprocessing, evaluating performance (accuracy, precision, recall).

### 7. Real-Time Data Analysis
   - **Task**: Implement a system to analyze real-time data from a robot or drone, such as sensor readings, using Python.
   - **Skills Covered**: Real-time data processing, event-driven programming, data streaming.

## Final Project

As a final project, you will develop a full data analysis and AI solution for the team’s robotics project. This could involve building a predictive model for sensor data, optimizing robot performance based on data insights, or developing real-time analysis tools that work with live data feeds from hardware components. You will collaborate with the back-end team for data collection and service integration.
