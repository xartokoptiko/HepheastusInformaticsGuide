# Hardware Developer Specification

This document outlines the tasks and skills required for hardware developers in the Hepheastus Informatics team. As a hardware developer, your primary role will involve creating software and firmware that allow various robotics projects, such as drones, rovers, and other systems, to function properly. Additionally, youâ€™ll be responsible for managing communication between hardware and software layers.

## Key Responsibilities

- Develop and optimize embedded systems and firmware for robotics hardware.
- Implement communication protocols between hardware components and cloud services.
- Test and debug hardware-software interactions.
- Collaborate with the back-end team for real-time data processing and communication.
- Simulate hardware behavior when physical devices are not available using platforms like Wokwi.

## Required Skills

To be successful as a hardware developer, you will need to possess the following skills:

- **Rust/C**: For developing high-performance, low-level code for hardware devices.
- **Embedded Systems**: Knowledge of microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ESP32.
- **Communication Protocols**: Understanding of I2C, SPI, UART, and other protocols.
- **Python**: For scripting, automation, and data processing related to hardware devices.
- **Wokwi Simulation**: Ability to simulate Arduino or ESP32 projects virtually.
- **Version Control (Git/GitHub)**: For managing firmware versions and collaborating with the team.

## Suggested Learning Roadmap

Below are tasks designed to help you acquire and develop the necessary hardware development skills.

### 1. Learn Embedded C/Rust for Microcontrollers
   - **Task**: Write a simple program that blinks an LED using C or Rust on a virtual Arduino using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).
   - **Skills Covered**: Basic embedded programming, pin control, timing functions.

### 2. Simulate a Sensor Reading on Wokwi
   - **Task**: Simulate a temperature sensor (like the DHT11) on Wokwi and display the data on a virtual LCD screen.
   - **Skills Covered**: Sensor integration, I2C communication, working with external libraries.

### 3. Learn Python for Scripting & Automation
   - **Task**: Write a Python script that collects data from a virtual sensor on Wokwi and sends it to a remote server (We will do this one together).
   - **Skills Covered**: Python requests library, data handling, HTTP communication with back-end services.

### 4. Implement Communication Protocols (I2C, SPI, UART)
   - **Task**: Simulate communication between two virtual devices on Wokwi using I2C or SPI.
   - **Skills Covered**: Master-slave communication, data transmission protocols.

### 5. Build a Basic Robot Control System
   - **Task**: Using Wokwi, simulate a basic robot that responds to user input to move forward, backward, left, or right.
   - **Skills Covered**: Motor control, UART communication, event-driven programming.

### 6. Integrate Hardware with Cloud Services
   - **Task**: Build a system that collects data from a virtual sensor on Wokwi and sends it to a cloud server for analysis (Once again we will do this one together).
   - **Skills Covered**: IoT principles, HTTP requests, cloud data integration.
